🎓 Project Spotlight: Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning & Web Deployment 🧠💻

I’m thrilled to share my latest project where I combined Machine Learning with Web Development to build an intelligent system that predicts breast cancer diagnoses from patient data. This project not only deepened my understanding of data science but also demonstrated the transformative power of AI in healthcare.

🌟 Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. Early detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment. In this project, I developed a predictive model that uses key medical attributes to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors.

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used:

Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and model building

Flask for deploying the ML model on the web

VS Code for full-stack development

HTML/CSS for frontend interface

📊 Machine Learning Models Implemented:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM) 🔥 (Best Performance – Accuracy: 98.24%)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Random Forest Classifier

✅ Models were evaluated using Accuracy, and confusion matrix visualizations for performance clarity.

🧬 Dataset Highlights:

30 medical features such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.

Target label: Diagnosis (Benign or Malignant)

Performed data cleaning, outlier handling, correlation analysis, and visualization using heatmaps and bar graphs

🌐 Web Application Features:

User can input values of all 30 features

Model instantly predicts the likelihood of the tumor being cancerous or not

Built using Flask framework with a clean and responsive HTML frontend

All models tested and validated for reliability



🎯 Applications & Future Scope:

Can be integrated into clinical decision support systems

Scope to expand into other types of cancer and medical diagnostics

Improve prediction using deep learning or ensemble methods

🧠 This project taught me a lot about real-world data science, model evaluation, and the importance of making ML accessible through web interfaces.
